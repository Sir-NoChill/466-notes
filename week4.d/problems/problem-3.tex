Recall the independence of observations for the expectation function, and the rule of constants:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[X + Y] &= \mathbb{E}[X] + \mathbb{E}[Y]\\
  \mathbb{E}[\alpha] = \alpha
\end{align*}

From these two rules, we can first seperate the two functions from each other:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{E}[\alpha f(X) + \beta g(X)] = \mathbb{E}[\alpha f(X)] + \mathbb{E}[\beta g(X)]
\end{equation*}
Since we know that the expectation of a constant is that constant, we can extract the constants
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}[\alpha f(X) + \beta g(X)] = \alpha\mathbb{E}[f(X)] + \beta\mathbb{E}[g(X)]
\end{equation*}
as required.\qed
