We solve each section in turn.

\section{Part 1}

The probability of the car being behind the door is $\frac{1}{3}$

\section{Part 2}

The assignment provides the following hints:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We can analyze this using Baye's Theorem:
        \begin{equation*}
          P(A=1|B=1) = \frac{P(A=1)P(B=1|A=1)}{P(A=1)P(B=1|A=1)+P(A=2)P(B=1|A=2)+P(A=3)P(B=1|A=3)}
        \end{equation*}
  \item Numerator: $\frac{1}{6}$
  \item Denominator: $\frac{3}{6}$
\end{enumerate}

We can plug the numbers in and we get that $P(A=1|B=1)=\frac{2}{3}$

\section{Part 3}

We should switch doors. We can compute $P(A=2|B=1) = \frac{1}{3}$, and so it is more likely that the car is behind the other door.
